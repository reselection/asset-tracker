# asset-tracker
<p>With the use of an API this program will track requested stocks and some crypto.</p>
User can request a ticker profile or quote right now.
For now i won't add GUI functionality and keep it in the terminal.

to fix:
 - Issue where you can request a non existing ticker and recieve an empty list, which can cause a crash if you request a specific filter on that data
